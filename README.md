# Predicting House Prices using Linear Regression

Introduction:
The goal of this research is to develop a linear regression model that can forecast home prices in relation to a variety of factors. The population, average income, house age, number of beds and rooms, and matching home prices are all included in the dataset that was used. Understanding how these characteristics affect home values is the aim, as is creating a model that reliably forecasts prices based on these variables.
